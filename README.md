# Scholar

An app that scans your Google Classroom assignments and puts them into a Notion Calendar.

## Usage

### Keys

Create a Google Cloud account with these two links:

- https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-project
- https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials

Then, create a Notion integration here:

- https://www.notion.so/my-integrations
  Make sure the integration has access to your database by inviting it with the share button in Notion

After that, create a Twilio account here:
